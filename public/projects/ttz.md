Fullstack application created with the MERN stack. The heart of the application is the ability to play Tic-Tac-Toe online with friends or locally in your browser. Features include secure user authentication, persistent game states and themes, and profile pages. The frontend was created with Next.js, TailwindCSS, and DaisyUI. The backend was created with TypeScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The frontend was deployed on Vercel and the backend API was deployed onto the Google Cloud Platform as a Dockerized application.
