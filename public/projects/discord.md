description: Server-Side Application interacting with the Discord API

---
Inspired by the predictions system on Twitch, a client requested a Discord Bot which can automatically track user engagement and create predictions in their server. To accomplish that, this project was coded in Typescript and Node.js while using the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) framework to interact with the [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference). The project was deployed to a custom Debian virtual machine on Vultr with continuous builds managed pushed via Git Version Control. Add it to your own server [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=724635854944993281&permissions=60398136432&scope=bot%20applications.commands)
